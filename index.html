            <p>Short post today. More of the same preceding this post.</p>
<h1 id="Strings"><a href="#Strings" class="headerlink" title="Strings"></a>Strings</h1><p>I finally noticed something that I was doing differently between my various<br>fetch template function calls. I’ve got different single and double quote<br>usage. I don’t know if this has been my problem, but I am going to spend some<br>time learning about JavaScript. While I feel like I understand very well the<br>way JavaScript handles data structures and functions, there are still aspects<br>of the language that surprise me.</p>

            <p>I have reached an extremely difficult sticking point this week, one that I am<br>currently seeking help with.</p>
<h1 id="What-it-is"><a href="#What-it-is" class="headerlink" title="What it is"></a>What it is</h1><p>When I try to open mustache files on my server, sometimes I don’t get the files<br>opened that I want. I know that the failure is with the template fetching<br>function because the logic inside the success attribute of the AJAX object that<br>handles such fetching isn’t running.</p>
<p>All of my other logic works, so I am absolutely sure that the problem is with<br>my template fetching function. But wait! There’s more…</p>
<h1 id="The-template-fetching-function-works"><a href="#The-template-fetching-function-works" class="headerlink" title="The template fetching function works"></a>The template fetching function works</h1><p>What? How can that be. If the problem is with the template fetching function,<br>how can it possibly be working? Well you see, any time it is required to fetch<br>a template that <em>isn’t</em> the nav_bar template, it works just fine. In fact, it<br>even passes the tests I wrote for it, which of course require it to fetch a<br>template, because, honestly, what would be the point of the test if it didn’t?</p>
<h1 id="Well-Travis-you’ve-probably-misspelled-the-file-name"><a href="#Well-Travis-you’ve-probably-misspelled-the-file-name" class="headerlink" title="Well, Travis, you’ve probably misspelled the file name"></a>Well, Travis, you’ve probably misspelled the file name</h1><p>Already checked on that, but thanks for the heads up. That’s not the problem.<br>It was also the last alternative that I could think of that could be the<br>problem. I’ve already looked into every other call of the function as well. I<br>can’t discern anything that I’m doing differently for this function call than<br>any other.</p>
<h1 id="Maybe-work-on-another-problem"><a href="#Maybe-work-on-another-problem" class="headerlink" title="Maybe work on another problem?"></a>Maybe work on another problem?</h1><p>Actually, this is the last bug that I’m trying to quash. I only have two tests<br>that are failing. The ones that are failing are both failing because of the<br>same nav_bar loading error. It’s really annoying. I’m now <em>very</em> far behind<br>the schedule that I had set for myself. I’m definitely going to need to<br>reassess my goals at the end of this trauma, because this has eaten a <em>ton</em> of<br>my time.</p>

            <p>Today I will address concerns I have about how I am spending my time and the<br>next hurdle I have to overcome. In that order.</p>
<h1 id="How-I-Am-Spending-My-Time"><a href="#How-I-Am-Spending-My-Time" class="headerlink" title="How I Am Spending My Time"></a>How I Am Spending My Time</h1><p>I’m at a phase in this project where I am not truly implementing anything.<br>Everything I am doing for the moment is bugfixes. Debugging requires a lot of<br>thought about what exactly it is that is going on. For me, sitting and staring<br>at code doesn’t help me. I have to identify a problem, think about it, address<br>it in a way that I have come up with during the thinking phase, and then<br>identify a new problem.</p>
<p>This manner of work means that I have short intense bursts of productivity and<br>long periods of reflection. I have not been counting these long periods of<br>reflection in my time totals. The reason I do this is that I work on other<br>things while I reflect on my problems. For example, I might have a problem with<br>an AJAX call, stop counting my time, and then write a paper for another classs.<br>While I am writing that paper, an idea for how to fix my call will pop into my<br>head. I’ll make a note of the idea, and then finish my paper writing session.<br>Once I am free, I’ll start counting my time for Glacialus again until I am done<br>implementing and testing my fix.</p>
<p>My concern is how little time this means that I have spent on my project in the<br>last week. I only logged six and a half hours toward my project. I’m not sure<br>I’ll be able to keep up with expectations with only this amount of time worked.<br>I also don’t know how to dedicate more time to the project and have it actually<br>be useful.</p>
<h1 id="AJAX"><a href="#AJAX" class="headerlink" title="AJAX"></a>AJAX</h1><p>Okay, that’s enough anxiety. Time to talk about real solutions to real<br>problems.</p>
<p>I wrote some dumb code.</p>
<p>I should elaborate. I wrote code that ran synchronously when I thought I was<br>writing code that would run asynchronously. This meant that my asynchronous<br>code ran long before the code I had written for it to depend on took effect.<br>Thankfully this problem is seemingly isolated to my test suite. Once I have<br>this problem fixed, I will be able to dedicate a considerable amount of time to<br>actually testing my project.</p>
<p>Speaking of…</p>
<h1 id="Testing"><a href="#Testing" class="headerlink" title="Testing"></a>Testing</h1><p>There is only one test left to write and run. That is really exciting for me.<br>Once all of my code is passing all of the tests I have created, I’ll be able to<br>open up my project in a web browser and see how well it truly works. I<br>anticipate making adjustments and fixing problems that I have not forseen, but<br>I am about to be done with a very major milestone. Once this is complete, I<br>will be able to start playing with some truly interesting concepts.</p>
<p>The next phase of the project after testing is complete is to seperate the<br>description of content and the description of the website into two different<br>files. While this does not sound very exciting in itself, it set me up to work<br>on having seperate markdown content files.</p>

            <p>This is the end of the first of two weeks of measured work. I’m facing some<br>frustration as a result of the way my week is structured and also some bugs.</p>
<h1 id="Timing"><a href="#Timing" class="headerlink" title="Timing"></a>Timing</h1><p>The bulk of the work I do for Glacialus is done on Thursday and Friday night,<br>with me cutting into the weekend if necessary. This week some personal<br>responsibilities saw me unavailable to work on this project thursday night.<br>This means that I am coming into the Friday class time with only two hours of<br>outside work. I do not feel good about how this looks at the end of the first<br>week.</p>
<p>The thing is, I still have six hours of work blocked out for this project on<br>Friday afternoon. The time breakdown should still work out in my favor. One<br>might even ask why I am making my blog post when I could just work for a few<br>more hours outside of class and then submit my post. There’s no schedule for<br>when blog posts are due.</p>
<p>Even though there is no schedule for when blog posts are due, I am following a<br>schedule of my own creation. My course load is very intense, so I have time<br>blocked out very specifically during the entire week. This includes a<br>designated time for blogging. I am writing all of my blog posts for this class<br>during class times.</p>
<h1 id="Testing-the-first-hitch"><a href="#Testing-the-first-hitch" class="headerlink" title="Testing, the first hitch"></a>Testing, the first hitch</h1><p>Up until this point, the tasks that I have laid out for myself have taken about<br>the amount of time I had set out for them. Writing my tests took far longer<br>than I had expected. So now I’m behind the adjusted schedule that I had created<br>for my major report.</p>
<p>I don’t think this reflect well on me, especially given that it flared up at<br>the same time as the timing problem. I am no behind on time, and behind<br>schedule for the time that I have.</p>
<p>I plan to address this issue in my trello board at the end of this weekend. For<br>right now though, I would like to focus on my project rather than on the<br>management of it.</p>
<h1 id="Event-listeners"><a href="#Event-listeners" class="headerlink" title="Event listeners"></a>Event listeners</h1><p>That’s enough talking about this project from the standpoint of a manager. I<br>want to talk about this project from the standpoint of a computer programmer.</p>
<p>One of the keys to the success of this project is to create event listeners<br>dynamically. These event listeners are meant to pay attention to a click on an<br>element in the navigation bar. This is something I have done before for another<br>project, but for some reason, I’m having trouble this time. I think there needs<br>to be some sort of update to the Document Object Model for this to be possible<br>because right now, what is happening is that the document doesn’t contain an<br>element by the name of the element that I created one line previous.</p>
<p>So that’s what’s next for me. Learning about how to add event listeners to my<br>document after I’ve just created elements.</p>

            <p>We are currently experiencing a period of steady work, intended to advance our<br>projects further. I am currently very near to a milestone point in my project.</p>
<h1 id="Unit-Testing"><a href="#Unit-Testing" class="headerlink" title="Unit Testing"></a>Unit Testing</h1><p>I am very close to finishing up with the writing of unit tests. I am using<br>QUnit to write my tests. It’s a very nice testing framework that utilizes<br>callbacks for running tests. I am very happy with how the tests are written.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to running my tests so that I can quickly fix any problems<br>that exist in my code base and move forward. I am hoping that by the end of<br>this week that I will be able to write documentation. If I’m really clever,<br>I’ll post my documentation as a blog post.</p>
<p>I really don’t have much more to say for today. That’s just kind of where I am<br>right now. Nothing new or exciting is going up, but the important things<br>central to the project are happening, even though they’re kind of dry.</p>

    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">

      
      

      
        
          
            <p>This past has been a rush to get all the things I had wanted to create into a<br>reality of some shape. I hope to describe what’s done and what there is to do.</p>
<h1 id="index-html"><a href="#index-html" class="headerlink" title="index.html"></a>index.html</h1><p>This is the first file that the browser receives from the server. Its job is to<br>deliver to the browser all the JavaScript that I am writing to make the really<br>cool dynamic work I’m doing appear. If I excluded the JavaScript I’m writing,<br>my index.html file would appear as totally blank in a web browser.</p>
<p>But surely it contains something, you must be thinking. Actually, yes. It is<br>full of elements whose inner HTML gets set by the JavaScript.</p>
<h1 id="glacialus-js"><a href="#glacialus-js" class="headerlink" title="glacialus.js"></a>glacialus.js</h1><p>Okay, that’s enough talking about what the JavaScript does to another file.<br>Let’s talk about the JavaScript itself, because that’s pretty cool.</p>
<p>The first thing I do is create an event listener. Event listeners are chunks of<br>script that get laid onto elements in the Document Object Model. Whenever an<br>action happens to a Docment Object that has a listener, the listener will<br>perform an action. This replaces the older functionality such as adding an<br>“onclick()” attribute to an HTML element.</p>
<p>The main advantage of an event listener instead of an “onclick()” attribute is<br>that you can put them all together in one readable place. You can also do some<br>really dynamic things such as adding event listeners inside of a for loop. This<br>will become important later when I create a navagation bar (more on that later).</p>
<p>The particular event listener I have created basically loads a site’s global<br>information. This is information about the site itself, and information about<br>the organization or individual who set up the site. The title of the site, the<br>slogan that the organization uses, their logo, any contact information that a<br>visitor would need to know, the favicon that goes in the tab the page is in,<br>these are examples of global data.</p>
<p>This initial set of actions also loads the home page. Every website needs a page<br>named “Home.” If a home page is not found, the website will not render. Because<br>there are many times when a search for a page will be performed, I have created<br>a page search function. If a page is found in list, some form of action will be<br>taken. I say some form of action because that is passed to the function as a<br>callback function.</p>
<p>While I’m describing functions I’ve created, I also have an insert html<br>function. It receives a template, in the form of a mustache file (more on that<br>later), an object, and the name of an element to receive the data. This is an<br>action that happens any time a link is clicked, and is performed multiple times<br>during the site initiation phase. Basic DRY programming, really.</p>
<p>Another action I found myself performing enough to warrant creating a function<br>for it was adding text to the end of an already populated element. Basically<br>all this function does is pull text from an element, store it in a temporary<br>location, add a string that was passed as an argument, and then put the result<br>into the original element. I could see this being useful later if I decide to<br>introduce blog functionality to my project.</p>
<p>The heart of my project is a function named “load_page” This is a function that<br>will be called anytime a new page is requested, which will be the most frequent<br>action in my project. Right now all this function does is load some sort of page<br>tite and content to go in the body of the document. In the future I would like<br>to use this function to also populate a navigation bar and introduce event<br>listeners to those links.</p>
<h1 id="Mustache"><a href="#Mustache" class="headerlink" title="Mustache"></a>Mustache</h1><p>Earlier I mentioned that I was using Mustache templates. Mustache is a<br>templating engine. It’s basically an easy markup to use to create more<br>interesting, interactive web pages. Right now I only have a contact template and<br>a social media links template. Nothing too exciting. Actually, nothing about<br>Mustache is very exciting to talk about. That’s what’s so exciting about it.<br>Using it requires minimal headachage.</p>
<p>The next template I create will likely be a template for a navbar of some sort.</p>
<h1 id="To-Do"><a href="#To-Do" class="headerlink" title="To Do"></a>To Do</h1><p>I’m sure you’ve figured this out by now, but I’m probably going to be doing the<br>navigation bar next. I consider the navigation bar’s functionality to be just as<br>critical as the load page function. The reason for this is that the navigation<br>bar basically acts as a set of listeners whose only job it is to run the load<br>page function.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I also think that the most likely way to load the navigation bar<br>is to use the load page function. When a page is loaded, it in some way needs to<br>be acknowledged as the current page, so loading the navigation bar with the<br>current page so that the bar reflects the page makes the most sense to me.</p>
<p>I’m not excactly sure how to end this blog post. Sooooooooooooooooooooooooo…<br>BYE!</p>

            <p>My last post was very brief. The post before that was unfinished. Here’s what’s going on.</p>
<h1 id="What’s-going-on"><a href="#What’s-going-on" class="headerlink" title="What’s going on"></a>What’s going on</h1><p>I have an easier time representing information in the form of physical objects that I can move around. In order to best leverage this, I had created a representation of my model using index cards. I had also created a flow chart using staples, index cards, and paper.</p>
<p>Alas, scanners would ultimately be an insurmountable problem for the time frame of the assignments that were due September 16th, 2016.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people would just recreate their information as digital formats, but the way I have thought of my information would take more time to represent using traditional diagramming techniques. Creating a program for diagramming the way I think would probably be an interesting project in itself.</p>
<p>The reason it is so difficult to recreate my models in traditional drawings is that I had created all of my pieces in a modular fashion. Parts of what I had wanted to present could me removed and replaced and rearranged because that was more accurate to how my software will work.</p>
<p>The problem now is that one of my models won’t scan entirely, and the other one has been completely destroyed. That’s really all I have to say about this. It’s an all around frustrating situation, and I’ve lost an entire week and have very little to show for it. Now I’ll have to work longer over the course of the next few weeks to make up for the time that was lost this week.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>I’m not happy.</p>

            <p>Most projects deal with information. All web applications do. Mine is one of those.</p>
<h1 id="My-Model"><a href="#My-Model" class="headerlink" title="My Model"></a>My Model</h1><p>One of the problems I have to tackle with my project is that depending on a website maintainer’s needs, different information will be represented on the website. I needed to figure out what information would always be required, what information would only appear sometimes, and how that information should all look in order for the framework to understand how it should be formatted.</p>
<p>This means that there isn’t a single schema or entity relational model that describes my project. Instead, there are various valid object compositions with smaller add ons that can be included or excluded depending on the needs of the user. These add ons need to be formatted correctly in order for the website to be constructed.</p>
<p>In order to represent this dynamic set of data, I created a stack of index cards and got out a piece of paper. Hopefully as we start diving into my model, this way of representing information in a modular way will help to better explain what information is sometimes present and what information should always be present.</p>
<h2 id="What-data-is-needed"><a href="#What-data-is-needed" class="headerlink" title="What data is needed?"></a>What data is needed?</h2><p>To answer that question, I have a piece of paper with two index cards stapled to it.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OB1rVvJ.png" alt="base model" title="This is the base model. This information is absolutely required for the website to display"></p>
<p>Every website must absolutely have a title. This is the name of the website. For example, if you were to visit <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.google.com/</a> you would probably call the website as a whole, the one that includes “google.com” in the domain name no matter what page you’re on, as <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">“Google”</a></p>
<p>Every website has one or many pages. In order to anticipate many pages, I am keeping pages in a list format. A website’s maintainer might only put one page in that list of pages, but it still needs to be in a list format.</p>
<p>Every page is pretty simple. It has a title and it has content. Its title is its identifier that lets visitors of the website know what they are looking at. Content is the stuff that a visitor would want to look at. For example a page might be titled “Photos” and the content would be actual photos that the users want to look at.</p>
<p>Every website also needs to have a page titled “Home”. This is so my JavaScript code can know which content should be loaded when a visitor first arrives at a website.</p>
<h2 id="How-are-the-different-kinds-of-data-related-to-eachother"><a href="#How-are-the-different-kinds-of-data-related-to-eachother" class="headerlink" title="How are the different kinds of data related to eachother?"></a>How are the different kinds of data related to eachother?</h2><p>For this I created a stack of index cards. Let me begin by explaining a slightly basic concept and then a more complicated concept.</p>
<h3 id="Modules"><a href="#Modules" class="headerlink" title="Modules"></a>Modules</h3><p>This is the more basic concept. I need to explain it first because the more complicated concept is based on this one.</p>

            <p>Last week we presented our project ideas as well as time frames for how long each milestone should take.</p>
<p>Mine can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MJsbFR9jXyyolO_t0ncXi5k6k0-4hgj8jirFA6PSxG4/present#slide=id.p" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Effect"><a href="#Effect" class="headerlink" title="Effect"></a>Effect</h1><p>I think I was effective in giving information while not overloading my groupmates with specifics in my talking points. I gave explanations for what a milestone actually was rather than what components were necessary to complete it. I most need to be familiar with the specifics. They need to understand the generalities of my project before they can begin to care about my specifics.</p>
<p>I wish I had done better creating visuals that actually explained what I was doing, but that’s not really how I think through problems. It’s really hard for me to present visuals to explain what I’m thinking to others when how I work through what I’m thinking is with a pen and a piece of paper. Most people would think I was drawing diagrams based on what I just said, but really I’m writing down what problems I’m having with my system or someone else’s existing systems, and then writing down possible solutions.</p>
<p>I really only start drawing things when I’m worrying about user experience problems, which I will be doing very soon as we start to implement our projects. My first milestone is to create a working website by interpretting a JSON file. The time I will the most be thinking about user experience will be now, so very shortly, I should have drawings for this blog.</p>
