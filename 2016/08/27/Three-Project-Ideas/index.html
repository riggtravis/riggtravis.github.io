        <p>This is my first post on this blog, so I think I’d like to introduce it just a<br>little bit before I get things going. This is my development blog. I post about<br>things I am working on. Right now, I’m working on my senior capstone at Berea<br>College. These are a few ideas that I’ve been thinking about to work on.</p>
<h1 id="Twitter-Bot-Detector"><a href="#Twitter-Bot-Detector" class="headerlink" title="Twitter Bot Detector"></a>Twitter Bot Detector</h1><p>Someone in our class pitched the idea of a Twitter Bot as a project. I, being a<br>contrarian, immediately thought to myself that I should build a Twitter Bot<br>Detector.</p>
<p>After looking into the viability of this project, I found that the University<br>of Texas had already done this, so I looked at their work. There are several<br>parts of detecting a twitter bot, all related to different aspects of a bot’s<br>behavior.</p>
<p>The first thing to look at is how much content is the bot creating, and how much<br>is it regurgitating via retweets. An actual human person will on occasion have<br>something to say about something. It might be how their day was, it might be<br>what they had for breakfast, it might be an excited tweet about the future<br>times. Whatever it is, a human person will do this along side retweeting things<br>that they found nifty.</p>
<p>The next tell tale sign of a twitter bot is the times of activity. Actual human<br>people have things they have to do through out their day. They need sleep, they<br>need food, they have to interact with physical people in the physical world,<br>they need to rotate their fluids. Twitter bots don’t have to do any of these<br>things. When looking at a human person’s twitter feed, it will have sporadic<br>activity; it will have periods of rapid tweeting and retweeting followed by<br>large blocks of doing other things. Twitter bots deviate from this behavior.<br>They can have rather constant streams of activity.</p>
<p>Of course, modern twitter bots are sophisticated enough to pass both of these<br>tests. The next analyses are a little more sophisticated. They require<br>information and language processing that might be a little complex for a single<br>semester of work. I’m still going to describe them because I might decide that<br>they are actually simple enough, or someone else in our class might say to<br>themselves, “Hey. Travis might not be very good at these things, but I’ve done<br>them before, I feel really comfortable with them.”</p>
<p>The next thing that Twitter Bots don’t have in common with human people is<br>sensible social networks. Human people have friends who know their other friends<br>You can reasonably expect a human user of twitter to have several followers who<br>not only follow the account in question, but also follow the several other<br>accounts that follow them as well as the account in question. This however does<br>need to take into consideration extremely popular twitter accounts as well as<br>verified accounts (which are generally popular).</p>
<p>Even so, twitter bot builders have gotten sophisticated enough to subvert this<br>test method as well. They’ll set up several bot accounts that all follow<br>each other creating a social network of bots. I’m sure there are still ways to<br>detect this form of activity, but what I’m not sure about is how to do this. I<br>would probably put more thought into the next detection method before coming<br>back around to this.</p>
<p>Human people usually use language in a certain way. One example would be that<br>human people don’t say “human people.” I’ve been doing that through this portion<br>of the blog post to get ready for this part of it. A bot detector needs to do<br>some language processing to see how human a questionable account seems to be in<br>its tweets. Ideally this mechanism would be quite robust, but a language<br>processor could make an entire project in itself. For the purposes of this<br>course, the bot detector’s ability to process language should be very basic.</p>
<p>Each on their own, these methods can create quite a few false positives, or miss<br>advanced bots that successfully circumvent their methods. One needs to gather<br>results from each method and process them in order to come to an actual<br>conclusion. The first method I thought of to compile this data was a neural<br>network, but there are probably other ways as well.</p>
<p>Conveniently, these are five different parts of creating a twitter bot detector,<br>and they are all rather modular. I think the completion of each component in<br>order make for excellent milestones for our senior projects course. I don’t<br>think spacing the components evenly is a wise plan though. The content vs<br>regurgitation component should take less time than the others, though it is<br>also the first component and needs to take learning how twitter handles data<br>into consideration. Content vs regurgitation should take two weeks.</p>
<p>The activity monitor is also pretty simple, and should take about the same<br>amount of time as the content vs regurgitation component. However, the<br>programmer will already be familiar with how Twitter handles data by this time.<br>I think this should only take a week.</p>
<p>This leaves 12 weeks to handle the big problems. I would allocate four weeks to<br>social network analysis, three to handle language processing, and two to set up<br>a neural network. I’ve given language processing a little less time because I<br>don’t think I can possibly come up with something adequate even given the whole<br>semester. I do however I think I can come up with something super basic if given<br>three weeks given some of the excellent resources available to us here at Berea<br>College in the form of our professors. Two weeks might seem like a long time to<br>set up a neural network, but in my experience, the tools for this are buggy and<br>poorly documented.</p>
<p>This leaves three weeks for testing and fixing. That is less time than I would<br>like for a project of this complexity, especially given that attempts at<br>budgeting time for it might be way off scale for how much any component that<br>turns out to be more complex than initially believed. That being said, after<br>writing out the necessary steps, this project seems much more realistic than it<br>had when it was bouncing around in my head.</p>
<p>This project also gives me an opportunity to grow because it is so different<br>from the things that I have been working on. The problem for me is that I don’t<br>think it gives me any utility growth, that being growth I can use. It would be<br>a fun project centered around things I don’t know much about, but I don’t see<br>a future path that would be strengthened by this project.</p>
<p>I still feel like all of this was more than I could handle over a single<br>semester. I think I would be more interested in it if no one had done anything<br>in the field, or enough people had done work on the problem that I could make a<br>small tweak on a proven concept to make something interesting.</p>
<p>Taking a proven concept and putting a small tweak on it to create something<br>interesting brings me into my next topic…</p>
<h1 id="Email-Client"><a href="#Email-Client" class="headerlink" title="Email Client"></a>Email Client</h1><p>Using Node and Electron, JavaScript can be used for nearly anything. I would<br>like to play with creating an email client using electron.</p>
<p>Sending email using HTML formatted text can be really annoying when there’s a<br>WYSIWYG editing pane that refuses to rest control when the user asks for it<br>(looking at you, Evolution). I would like to create one that has an editing<br>pane on the left that displays in plain text, and a preview window on the right<br>that displays what the email will look like to its recipient.</p>
<p>This email client would not be comprehensive. It would only support the most<br>widely used protocols such as IMAP. Protocols like Exchange would be too big to<br>worry about in a single semester. I would rather focus on creating a well<br>polished, easy to use, basic email client than a feature complete email client<br>that doesn’t look nice. There’s Mutt for that.</p>
<p>I think it’s worth considering when thinking about both the user interface and<br>milestones for the project what the views in an email client are. Usually you<br>have a pane for your folders, a pane that displays your emails in a list format,<br>a pane that displays the content of a single email, a pane for composing your<br>email, and a set up pane. That is five panes total.</p>
<p>While it might seem like the best plan is to divide the term into milestones for<br>each of these components, I think a better plan would be to cycle through these<br>components rapidly, and improve them on each cycle. What I mean by this is that<br>instead of blocking out 3 weeks straight to work on the composition pane, I<br>would maybe spend each of my sessions in those three weeks working on a single<br>view, creating an iteration of the whole every three weeks.</p>
<p>The work schedule I have set up for myself includes five hours on Thursday and<br>five hours on Friday each week to work on my project. I would do something like<br>Spending the Thursday of the start of each three week cycle designing how I want<br>things to work, and then the Friday working on one component. The next week I<br>would spend Thursday one of the remaining four components, and Friday working on<br>one of the remaining three. In the third and final week of each cycle I would<br>work on the two components I hadn’t worked on yet.</p>
<p>This gives a sort of release cycle milestone set up that I think would work a<br>lot like working on a novella or paper. First you create a rough draft, one in<br>this case that might not even function completely properly. The first editing<br>session you spend figuring out what you like and don’t like about your rough<br>draft, making changes to the structure of your rough draft, and fixing major<br>bugs with the system, producing a second draft.</p>
<p>The reason I refer to the releases as drafts is that you might come up with an<br>interface concept that in practice isn’t as good as you thought it was, so then<br>you would have to spend quite a bit of time making major changes to the way<br>things were. The other reason is that much like in writing a paper, there are<br>going to be errors in the code of the program. This is especially true because<br>Electron is a technology that I am not familiar with working on from scratch.<br>Any programming that I have done in the environment has been working with a<br>preexisting project.</p>
<p>It’s sort of strange to think that one of the ideas I’m considering is centered<br>around a user interface idea that I have. User interfaces always presented me<br>problems when they were introduced in whatever programming language tutorial<br>I was working through. I am hopeful that my experience using MinCSS to style<br>pages will provide some help, given that Electron apps are essentially web<br>pages.</p>
<p>Just as interesting twists on ideas drew me directly into this idea, web pages<br>draws me into the next…</p>
<h1 id="Static-Web-Page-Generator"><a href="#Static-Web-Page-Generator" class="headerlink" title="Static Web Page Generator"></a>Static Web Page Generator</h1><p>A Static Web Page Framework takes input files and uses them to build a website.<br>I want to build one that doesn’t require compilation or installation.</p>
<p>This is the idea I have put the most thought into, which is why I have<br>presented it last. I wanted to give the other ideas I have a chance in the sun<br>in case someone else had interest in them. I don’t want my excited energy to<br>dissuade anyone else from thinking about my other ideas. I think they’re both<br>fun ideas that could be really interesting to play with, but this is the idea<br>that I’m the most interested in doing.</p>
<p>Over the summer, a friend of mine asked for help building a website for her<br>business. That website is still in progress, but over the course of getting<br>it to it’s current status (bug fixes), I learned a lot about creating a web page<br>by dynamically loading information into a view using JSON files. I still think<br>I can do better.</p>
<p>I want to create a general purpose static web page framework along these same<br>principles. All of the processing of data will be handled by the web browser.<br>This makes my project significantly different from something like Hexo. With<br>most Static Website Generators, you write files, and then run some form of<br>compilation. HTML files are output, and those are used for the website.</p>
<p>My project will require no compilation. A single HTML file will use JavaScript<br>to inject information into HTML elements. Before I have done this using JSON<br>files that contain the information that is to be injected. I would like to<br>use something more human readable like markdown. The specific tools that I would<br>use to make this happen would be Mustache.js, jQuery, and Markdown.js.</p>
<p>Milestones would be structured around how I set up my initial project. What I am<br>planning to do is to create a single JSON object that contains all the<br>information necessary to create a website. Each step of building my project<br>would entail removing a component from the object and moving it into another<br>file structure.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TRwYl69.jpg" alt="Example object"></p>
<p>The first milestone will be setting up the website to work on this base object.<br>Functionality can be drawn out of this object into other files for future<br>milestones. This first milestone is rather large because it includes such things<br>as writing the HTML code that will be used to display the content and<br>integrating Markdown.js and Mustache.js to turn the content into HTML. I expect<br>this to take two weeks.</p>
<p>The second milestone will be a simple one. I want to draw the site information<br>away from the basic starter object into its own file. This will include things<br>that are the same on every single page that the user visits like the title of<br>the website, the favicon, and the contact information of the site owner. This<br>milestone won’t take very long because it is so simple. I expect it to take a<br>week. This might seem like a lot of time to dedicate to this task, but I expect<br>there to be ideas I have to make this feature even better and more human<br>readable while I work on it.</p>
<p>The third milestone will be to draw content out of the main object and separate<br>it into markdown files. The content of files on a server can be accessed using<br>AJAX as long as the file name is known. This is why the filenames will still be<br>in the main object. In fact, at this point in the project, the filenames will be<br>the only things left in the object. I already have experience doing this, but it<br>still takes quite a bit of code to do. I think it will take me about two weeks.</p>
<p>The fourth milestone will be the hardest one. I want to get rid of the object<br>entirely. I would like to use a web server’s directory listing to gather the<br>names of all of the markdown files so that the JavaScript can pull content from<br>these files without being told explicitly what their names are. I think this<br>should take four weeks.</p>
<p>The final milestone will be to modify the project so that when someone searches<br>the web the content of the site can be queried by the search engine of their<br>choice. I’m not very sure how hard this will be, so I would like to dedicate<br>as much time to it as I did for the web server directory listing milestone.</p>
<p>All in all, this leaves three weeks for testing and fixing, as well as room for<br>if one of these tasks presents unforeseen problems and takes more time to work<br>on than was originally budgeted. That’s pretty accurate to how I want my<br>senior project to be structured, so I feel really comfortable with this idea<br>being the one I go forward with. I might be favoring it unfairly, but I just<br>think it fits the structure of this course better than my other ideas, and is<br>the one I have the most familiarity with.</p>
<p>A human readable compilation free static website framework could be a really<br>great thing for people hosting websites on servers and don’t know much about<br>creating web pages. It would provide a path for minimal set up, though it would<br>decrease the responsiveness and performance of the website. This is a sacrifice<br>I am willing to make for the sake of a fun project that does something<br>interesting.</p>
