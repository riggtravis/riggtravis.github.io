        <p>Next week I’m changing the CSS framework that my project uses. This seems crazy<br>but it’s actually my best chance at successfully finishing my project.</p>
<h1 id="Why-do-we-use-frameworks"><a href="#Why-do-we-use-frameworks" class="headerlink" title="Why do we use frameworks?"></a>Why do we use frameworks?</h1><p>The point of a framework is that it handles a large body of the work you would<br>need to do on your own if you weren’t using a framework. When I was first<br>learning about frameworks, I had trouble understanding what the difference<br>between a framework and a library. The way that I think of it now is that a<br>library is code that gives your code the ability to do something. A framework<br>is a body of code waiting for you to use your code to make it do something.</p>
<p>Frameworks are great for getting actual things done without having to worry<br>about doing tasks that someone else has already done for you. Yes, libraries<br>are great for this too, but the bulk of the work in the creation of your<br>project is still put into understanding lower level problems than what you are<br>ultimately trying to tackle. When you have a large project, tackling these<br>small low level problems will take up more of your time than is ultimately<br>worth it.</p>
<p>In this context, “large project” should be interpreted as anything that takes<br>longer than a weekend to create, at least in my mind. Your time is better spent<br>working on other things.</p>
<h1 id="Are-there-any-downsides-to-using-a-framework"><a href="#Are-there-any-downsides-to-using-a-framework" class="headerlink" title="Are there any downsides to using a framework?"></a>Are there any downsides to using a framework?</h1><p>Definitely. You are depending on someone else’s code. 99% of the time, this is<br>a good thing. The smart way to program is to rely on other people and trust<br>them. If every piece of software was only written by a single person, our most<br>advanced software projects might still be pong.</p>
<p>That other 1% of the time can be very messy. A framework falls apart as a<br>useful part of your toolkit when it doesn’t do what you expect it to. This<br>might be your own failure, selecting a framework that was ill suited for your<br>needs because you didn’t understand your own needs, or what that framework is<br>for. The other possibility is that the framework just doesn’t do what its<br>developer claimed it would do.</p>
<p>I avoid writing cascading style sheets(CSS) as much as I humanly can. CSS isn’t<br>something that interests me, and it can take hours just to get something small<br>and simple to look good. When I was doing the bulk of the writing code for my<br>senior project, I was using a framework for CSS that I have used in the past<br>and very happy with. I chose to use this framework because I was already<br>familiar with it and I wouldn’t need to learn anything new to use it.</p>
<p>It doesn’t deliver the results that I had come to expect though. It no longer<br>matches its documentation. The way I saw it, there were two options available<br>to me. I could dig into the code base of the new implementation of the<br>framework in order to keep using it, or I could start using a new framework. I<br>chose to go for the latter option.</p>
<p>I am moving my project to use Blazecss rather than what I was using before.<br>This will be an undertaking, but it will be a comparatively small undertaking.</p>
