      <p>I haven’t had much to show for lately in my debugging. Today I found some very<br>interesting bugs.</p>
<h1 id="What-was-going-on"><a href="#What-was-going-on" class="headerlink" title="What was going on?"></a>What was going on?</h1><p>None of my links were appearing upon loading the page. There were two factors<br>at play in this. The first was that the CSS framework I was using before was<br>squelching links. The second was that when I migrated I changed a name of an<br>element I was injecting content into.</p>
<p>When these links finally did appear, they weren’t links to anything. Something<br>was wrong with either my template or the navigation object I was creating. It<br>actually didn’t take me very long to discover that a double quote mark had been<br>left out. I never would have found this issue if I hadn’t already fixed the<br>other. It’s been a cycle of dependencies.</p>
<p>The most helpful aspect of this experience has been learning JavaScript<br>debugging strategies. I’m actually really happy about this.</p>
<h1 id="What’s-next"><a href="#What’s-next" class="headerlink" title="What’s next?"></a>What’s next?</h1><p>I have created an infinite loop of page loading. It’s actually quite a<br>disastrous bug. The trouble is that with each successive page load, the<br>website’s memory usage increases until eventually my computer freezes. I<br>suspect that somewhere I have an event listener that is listening for an<br>element to load rather than for a click on this element.</p>
