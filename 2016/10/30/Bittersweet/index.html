<h1 id="This-Past-Week…"><a href="#This-Past-Week…" class="headerlink" title="This Past Week…"></a>This Past Week…</h1><p>… has been strange. I feel wooden. With the assistance of Matt Jadud, I made<br>a breakthrough with my project. I am very optimistic about the progress I will<br>be able to make in the upcoming week. I do have some personal matters that I<br>need to attend to first though.</p>
<p>This past week I feel behind in all of my course work, including a major<br>project that is due early this week. Poor timing was the main<br>culprit. My grandfather passed away on Tuesday. I found this out while I was<br>feverishly ill. Legitimately, I didn’t realize his passing was real for about<br>two days. It still at this point is sinking in.</p>
<p>I won’t be able to attend the funeral. I’m too far behind in my course work to<br>think of it, and my poor little motorcycle wouldn’t be able to make the trip if<br>I could. This would seem like something that would upset me, but really it<br>isn’t. The last time I said goodbye to my grandfather, I knew it was my last<br>goodbye. His mind was failing him, and I got to say goodbye back when there was<br>still something to say goodbye to. </p>
<p>My time here at Berea College will be bookended with funerals for relatives who<br>struggled with mental health issues. Almost, these funerals frame my own<br>struggle with mental illness, but not entirely. The challenges that I have had<br>to overcome are challenges that I have to overcome every day for the rest of my<br>life. Taking some time to reflect on this has helped me to recenter my focus.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I didn’t know how I was going to structure any of the work I needed<br>to get done this week. I had a plan that got wrecked when someone I was<br>counting on backed out on a commitment last minute. Today I’ve had some time to<br>recenter and get back on track. I know that none of the course work I will<br>submit this upcoming week will be very good, but I will submit it. It will all<br>be okay.</p>
