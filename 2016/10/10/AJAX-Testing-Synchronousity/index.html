      <p>Today I will address concerns I have about how I am spending my time and the<br>next hurdle I have to overcome. In that order.</p>
<h1 id="How-I-Am-Spending-My-Time"><a href="#How-I-Am-Spending-My-Time" class="headerlink" title="How I Am Spending My Time"></a>How I Am Spending My Time</h1><p>I’m at a phase in this project where I am not truly implementing anything.<br>Everything I am doing for the moment is bugfixes. Debugging requires a lot of<br>thought about what exactly it is that is going on. For me, sitting and staring<br>at code doesn’t help me. I have to identify a problem, think about it, address<br>it in a way that I have come up with during the thinking phase, and then<br>identify a new problem.</p>
<p>This manner of work means that I have short intense bursts of productivity and<br>long periods of reflection. I have not been counting these long periods of<br>reflection in my time totals. The reason I do this is that I work on other<br>things while I reflect on my problems. For example, I might have a problem with<br>an AJAX call, stop counting my time, and then write a paper for another classs.<br>While I am writing that paper, an idea for how to fix my call will pop into my<br>head. I’ll make a note of the idea, and then finish my paper writing session.<br>Once I am free, I’ll start counting my time for Glacialus again until I am done<br>implementing and testing my fix.</p>
<p>My concern is how little time this means that I have spent on my project in the<br>last week. I only logged six and a half hours toward my project. I’m not sure<br>I’ll be able to keep up with expectations with only this amount of time worked.<br>I also don’t know how to dedicate more time to the project and have it actually<br>be useful.</p>
<h1 id="AJAX"><a href="#AJAX" class="headerlink" title="AJAX"></a>AJAX</h1><p>Okay, that’s enough anxiety. Time to talk about real solutions to real<br>problems.</p>
<p>I wrote some dumb code.</p>
<p>I should elaborate. I wrote code that ran synchronously when I thought I was<br>writing code that would run asynchronously. This meant that my asynchronous<br>code ran long before the code I had written for it to depend on took effect.<br>Thankfully this problem is seemingly isolated to my test suite. Once I have<br>this problem fixed, I will be able to dedicate a considerable amount of time to<br>actually testing my project.</p>
<p>Speaking of…</p>
<h1 id="Testing"><a href="#Testing" class="headerlink" title="Testing"></a>Testing</h1><p>There is only one test left to write and run. That is really exciting for me.<br>Once all of my code is passing all of the tests I have created, I’ll be able to<br>open up my project in a web browser and see how well it truly works. I<br>anticipate making adjustments and fixing problems that I have not forseen, but<br>I am about to be done with a very major milestone. Once this is complete, I<br>will be able to start playing with some truly interesting concepts.</p>
<p>The next phase of the project after testing is complete is to seperate the<br>description of content and the description of the website into two different<br>files. While this does not sound very exciting in itself, it set me up to work<br>on having seperate markdown content files.</p>
