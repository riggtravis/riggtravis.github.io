      <p>This is the end of the first of two weeks of measured work. I’m facing some<br>frustration as a result of the way my week is structured and also some bugs.</p>
<h1 id="Timing"><a href="#Timing" class="headerlink" title="Timing"></a>Timing</h1><p>The bulk of the work I do for Glacialus is done on Thursday and Friday night,<br>with me cutting into the weekend if necessary. This week some personal<br>responsibilities saw me unavailable to work on this project thursday night.<br>This means that I am coming into the Friday class time with only two hours of<br>outside work. I do not feel good about how this looks at the end of the first<br>week.</p>
<p>The thing is, I still have six hours of work blocked out for this project on<br>Friday afternoon. The time breakdown should still work out in my favor. One<br>might even ask why I am making my blog post when I could just work for a few<br>more hours outside of class and then submit my post. There’s no schedule for<br>when blog posts are due.</p>
<p>Even though there is no schedule for when blog posts are due, I am following a<br>schedule of my own creation. My course load is very intense, so I have time<br>blocked out very specifically during the entire week. This includes a<br>designated time for blogging. I am writing all of my blog posts for this class<br>during class times.</p>
<h1 id="Testing-the-first-hitch"><a href="#Testing-the-first-hitch" class="headerlink" title="Testing, the first hitch"></a>Testing, the first hitch</h1><p>Up until this point, the tasks that I have laid out for myself have taken about<br>the amount of time I had set out for them. Writing my tests took far longer<br>than I had expected. So now I’m behind the adjusted schedule that I had created<br>for my major report.</p>
<p>I don’t think this reflect well on me, especially given that it flared up at<br>the same time as the timing problem. I am no behind on time, and behind<br>schedule for the time that I have.</p>
<p>I plan to address this issue in my trello board at the end of this weekend. For<br>right now though, I would like to focus on my project rather than on the<br>management of it.</p>
<h1 id="Event-listeners"><a href="#Event-listeners" class="headerlink" title="Event listeners"></a>Event listeners</h1><p>That’s enough talking about this project from the standpoint of a manager. I<br>want to talk about this project from the standpoint of a computer programmer.</p>
<p>One of the keys to the success of this project is to create event listeners<br>dynamically. These event listeners are meant to pay attention to a click on an<br>element in the navigation bar. This is something I have done before for another<br>project, but for some reason, I’m having trouble this time. I think there needs<br>to be some sort of update to the Document Object Model for this to be possible<br>because right now, what is happening is that the document doesn’t contain an<br>element by the name of the element that I created one line previous.</p>
<p>So that’s what’s next for me. Learning about how to add event listeners to my<br>document after I’ve just created elements.</p>
