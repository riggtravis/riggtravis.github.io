      <p>Most projects deal with information. All web applications do. Mine is one of those.</p>
<h1 id="My-Model"><a href="#My-Model" class="headerlink" title="My Model"></a>My Model</h1><p>One of the problems I have to tackle with my project is that depending on a website maintainer’s needs, different information will be represented on the website. I needed to figure out what information would always be required, what information would only appear sometimes, and how that information should all look in order for the framework to understand how it should be formatted.</p>
<p>This means that there isn’t a single schema or entity relational model that describes my project. Instead, there are various valid object compositions with smaller add ons that can be included or excluded depending on the needs of the user. These add ons need to be formatted correctly in order for the website to be constructed.</p>
<p>In order to represent this dynamic set of data, I created a stack of index cards and got out a piece of paper. Hopefully as we start diving into my model, this way of representing information in a modular way will help to better explain what information is sometimes present and what information should always be present.</p>
<h2 id="What-data-is-needed"><a href="#What-data-is-needed" class="headerlink" title="What data is needed?"></a>What data is needed?</h2><p>To answer that question, I have a piece of paper with two index cards stapled to it.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OB1rVvJ.png" alt="base model" title="This is the base model. This information is absolutely required for the website to display"></p>
<p>Every website must absolutely have a title. This is the name of the website. For example, if you were to visit <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.google.com/</a> you would probably call the website as a whole, the one that includes “google.com” in the domain name no matter what page you’re on, as <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">“Google”</a></p>
<p>Every website has one or many pages. In order to anticipate many pages, I am keeping pages in a list format. A website’s maintainer might only put one page in that list of pages, but it still needs to be in a list format.</p>
<p>Every page is pretty simple. It has a title and it has content. Its title is its identifier that lets visitors of the website know what they are looking at. Content is the stuff that a visitor would want to look at. For example a page might be titled “Photos” and the content would be actual photos that the users want to look at.</p>
<p>Every website also needs to have a page titled “Home”. This is so my JavaScript code can know which content should be loaded when a visitor first arrives at a website.</p>
<h2 id="How-are-the-different-kinds-of-data-related-to-eachother"><a href="#How-are-the-different-kinds-of-data-related-to-eachother" class="headerlink" title="How are the different kinds of data related to eachother?"></a>How are the different kinds of data related to eachother?</h2><p>For this I created a stack of index cards. Let me begin by explaining a slightly basic concept and then a more complicated concept.</p>
<h3 id="Modules"><a href="#Modules" class="headerlink" title="Modules"></a>Modules</h3><p>This is the more basic concept. I need to explain it first because the more complicated concept is based on this one.</p>
