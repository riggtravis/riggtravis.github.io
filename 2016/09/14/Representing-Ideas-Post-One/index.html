        <p>Last week we presented our project ideas as well as time frames for how long each milestone should take.</p>
<p>Mine can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MJsbFR9jXyyolO_t0ncXi5k6k0-4hgj8jirFA6PSxG4/present#slide=id.p" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Effect"><a href="#Effect" class="headerlink" title="Effect"></a>Effect</h1><p>I think I was effective in giving information while not overloading my groupmates with specifics in my talking points. I gave explanations for what a milestone actually was rather than what components were necessary to complete it. I most need to be familiar with the specifics. They need to understand the generalities of my project before they can begin to care about my specifics.</p>
<p>I wish I had done better creating visuals that actually explained what I was doing, but that’s not really how I think through problems. It’s really hard for me to present visuals to explain what I’m thinking to others when how I work through what I’m thinking is with a pen and a piece of paper. Most people would think I was drawing diagrams based on what I just said, but really I’m writing down what problems I’m having with my system or someone else’s existing systems, and then writing down possible solutions.</p>
<p>I really only start drawing things when I’m worrying about user experience problems, which I will be doing very soon as we start to implement our projects. My first milestone is to create a working website by interpretting a JSON file. The time I will the most be thinking about user experience will be now, so very shortly, I should have drawings for this blog.</p>
