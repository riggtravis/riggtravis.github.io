        <p>My last post was very brief. The post before that was unfinished. Here’s what’s going on.</p>
<h1 id="What’s-going-on"><a href="#What’s-going-on" class="headerlink" title="What’s going on"></a>What’s going on</h1><p>I have an easier time representing information in the form of physical objects that I can move around. In order to best leverage this, I had created a representation of my model using index cards. I had also created a flow chart using staples, index cards, and paper.</p>
<p>Alas, scanners would ultimately be an insurmountable problem for the time frame of the assignments that were due September 16th, 2016.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people would just recreate their information as digital formats, but the way I have thought of my information would take more time to represent using traditional diagramming techniques. Creating a program for diagramming the way I think would probably be an interesting project in itself.</p>
<p>The reason it is so difficult to recreate my models in traditional drawings is that I had created all of my pieces in a modular fashion. Parts of what I had wanted to present could me removed and replaced and rearranged because that was more accurate to how my software will work.</p>
<p>The problem now is that one of my models won’t scan entirely, and the other one has been completely destroyed. That’s really all I have to say about this. It’s an all around frustrating situation, and I’ve lost an entire week and have very little to show for it. Now I’ll have to work longer over the course of the next few weeks to make up for the time that was lost this week.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>I’m not happy.</p>
